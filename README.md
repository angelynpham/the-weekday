# The Weekday

## Introduction

Welcome to The Weekday repository! This project is a recreated fan site of the renowned artist The Weeknd. It was developed using Figma for prototyping and HTML/CSS for website implementation. The aim of this project was to provide a modern and interactive fan experience while also serving as a learning opportunity in Figma and website development.
